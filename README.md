# MicroBio
A cellular strategy game written in Processing

## About

This game was created as a university project during the videogame course

It attempts to demonstrate several important videogame concepts- such as physics simulation,
AI control systems, animation and motion

It makes use of the Processing core libraries (included in the `lib` directory)
in order to provide a simple cross platform API for graphics, windowing, sound and user input

## Instructions

Build the project
```bash
make
```

Then run the project
```bash
make run
```

Optionally clean up after build
```bash
make clean
```
